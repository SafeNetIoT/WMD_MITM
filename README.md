This repository provides Python scripts and data for interacting with and testing the security of BLE-enabled wearable medical devices, including the SnapECG, Wellue BPM, Oxylink oximeter, and FreeStyle Libre 2 CGM.  
The repository contains the following main components:

- SnapECG Script: Python code for interacting with and testing the SnapECG device.
- Wellue BPM Script: Python code for interacting with and testing the Wellue Blood Pressure Monitor (BPM).
- Oxylink Oximeter Script: Python code for interacting with and testing the Oxylink oximeter.
- FreeStyle Libre 2 CGM Script: Python code for interacting with and testing the FreeStyle Libre 2 Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM).

**Features:**

- **Penetration Testing**: Tools and methods to conduct eavesdropping, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM), and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on BLE-enabled wearable medical devices.
- **Data Interaction**: Scripts for capturing and analyzing BLE data packets from various medical devices.
- **Security Analysis**: Insights into the vulnerabilities of BLE protocols used by these devices, with an emphasis on improving cybersecurity through a multilayered approach.


## Usage

### SnapECG Script
This script is used for interacting with the SnapECG device, capturing data packets, and analyzing vulnerabilities. It supports MITM attacks and packet sniffing.

### Wellue BPM Script
This script enables communication with the Wellue BPM, allowing for the testing of security features such as encryption and authentication mechanisms.

### Oxylink Oximeter Script
The Oxylink oximeter script provides tools to capture and manipulate BLE data packets, testing the security robustness of the device.

### FreeStyle Libre 2 CGM Script
The FreeStyle Libre 2 script is used for testing the security of the CGM, including the potential for DoS attacks.
